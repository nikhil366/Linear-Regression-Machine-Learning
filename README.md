# Linear-Regression-Machine-Learning
Here we will understand about Linear regression with Machine Learning and how we apply Statistics in Linear regression.

# Linear Regression Use :
So to understand linear regression first of all we have to understand in which area or Industry we can use linear regression to solve Buisness Problems.
1. Ecomerce Problem
2. Future Value Prediction

# Terms We have to understand before working on Linear regression (Evaluting Regression) :
1. Regression is for Continous Value or for Predict Continous Value.
2. Regression
3. Correlation
4. In Statistics - Mean, Median, Mode, Standrd Deviation, IQR
5. Dependent variable and Independent Variable
6. EDA (Exploratry Data Analysis)
7. Data Visualization with MatLab, Seaborn, Plotly etc.
8. train_test_split
9. coefficent - coef_
10. Mean Absolute Error(MAE) = Actual - Predicted = result
11. Mean Squared Error(MSE) = result ** 2
12. Root meanSquared Error(RMSE) = root of Mean Squared Error
13. R squared
14. Normal Distribution or Distribution in Statistics

# Process we have to follow before working on Data :
1. Convert Buisness problem to analytical Problem.
2. Data Collection
3. Statistics on Data
4. Exploratry Data Analysis
5. train_test_split
6.
